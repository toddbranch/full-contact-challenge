# full contact challenge - bidirectional infinite scroll

## setup

```
npm install
bower install

npm test
//You'll need to open the testem URL (localhost:7357 for me) to connect and run.
```

## demo

index.html - you'll need an internet connection because I load the libraries from cdnjs and use pug images from the web to show it in action.

## notes

Happy to discuss  potential optimizations / improvements as well as the tradeoffs I decided on when writing it.
